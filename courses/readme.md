## Courses/materials I am learning
---
- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50X 2022)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home)<br>
This is a biginner course about computer science. The first few weeks use C language to introduce some basic knowledge. The last few weeks introduce some other languages. I recommend taking CS50P before taking CS50x.<br>
